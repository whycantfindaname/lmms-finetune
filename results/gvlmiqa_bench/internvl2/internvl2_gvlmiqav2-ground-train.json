Low clarity[[2, 3, 998, 995]] impacts the entire image, making it difficult to discern specific details and reducing the overall sharpness of the flower's petals and central area.\nLocally, there are some quality issues impacting specific regions. Out of focus blur[[2, 3, 998, 523]] affects the upper portion of the image, particularly the petals, causing a loss of detail and making the texture appear less defined. Additionally, the lower-right area of the image is also impacted by out of focus blur[[2, 525, 998, 995]], further diminishing the clarity of the petals and the central white area."
